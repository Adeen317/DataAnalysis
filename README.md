# DataAnalysis
Consists of complete data analysis techniques.
### Data Analysis with Python
In this section we have covered data analysis techniques through python programming language. In order to perform analysis in python first we need to download several libraries as follows.
##### 1. pandas
##### 2. matplotlib
##### 3. numpy
##### 4. scikit-learn
##### 5. seaborn
##### 6. scipy

###### The above file consists of data analysis on two large dataset one is on the housing prices in the US whereas the other dataset is about the prices of different types of cars.
##### In order to access the analysis code for data of housing prices in the US click the header below:
- [Dataset of prices of house in US](https://github.com/Adeen317/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20wth%20Python/Housing%20Dataset%20in%20US/Data_Analysis_on_housing_datasets_USA.py)
###### In the analysis on the above dataset you will learn to find datatypes, dropping of columns, boxplot, regression plot, R-square value, Pipelining and other preprocessing techniques. 
##### In order to access the analysis code for data of car prices click the header below:
- [Dataset of prices of cars](https://github.com/Adeen317/DataAnalysis/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20wth%20Python/Categorized%20Dataset%20of%20Car%20Price)
###### The analysis on the above dataset is divided into four parts.
##### Part 1
- [Part 1](https://github.com/Adeen317/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20wth%20Python/Categorized%20Dataset%20of%20Car%20Price/Data_Analyst1_2.py)
###### >This part consists of reading the data from the URL & provides concise summary of the data.
###### >Counts and deals with missing values in the columns by replacing them with mean value of the column.
###### >Renaming and applying calculations in a column. 
###### >Check and convert datatypes. 
###### >Consists of normalization techniques (Simple Feature Scaling, Min Max Value & Z-score Value) of the data.
###### >Plots histogram after binning data in a column.

##### Part 2
- [Part 2](https://github.com/Adeen317/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20wth%20Python/Categorized%20Dataset%20of%20Car%20Price/Data_Analyst3.py)
###### >Check and converts neccessary datatypes accordingly. 
###### >This part shows the boxplot, scatterplot, jointplot, regression plot between the two columns.
###### >It also provides heatmap of combination of multiple columns.
###### >It consists of method to find correlation, Pearson correlaton(P-value) & Chi Square Value.
