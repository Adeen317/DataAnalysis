# DataAnalysis
Consists of complete data analysis techniques.
### Data Analysis with Python
In this section we have covered data analysis techniques through python programming language. In order to perform analysis in python first we need to download several libraries as follows.
###### 1. pandas
###### 2. matplotlib
###### 3. numpy
###### 4. scikit-learn

- The above file consists of data analysis on two large dataset one is on the housing prices in the US whereas the other dataset is about the prices of different types of cars.
- In order to access the code for Housing prices in US click the header below:
- [Dataset of prices of house in US](https://github.com/Adeen317/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20wth%20Python/Housing%20Dataset%20in%20US/Data_Analysis_on_housing_datasets_USA.py)
- In the analysis on the given dataset you will learn to find datatypes, dropping of columns, boxplot, regression plot, R-square value, Pipelining and other preprocessing techniques.
