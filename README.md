### Data Analysis with Python
In this section we have covered data analysis techniques through python programming language. In order to perform analysis in python first we need to download several libraries as follows.
##### 1. pandas
##### 2. matplotlib
##### 3. numpy
##### 4. scikit-learn
##### 5. seaborn
##### 6. scipy

##### The above file consists of data analysis on two large dataset one is on the housing prices in the US whereas the other dataset is about the prices of different types of cars.
#### Dataset of prices of house in US
##### In order to access the analysis code for data of housing prices in the US click the header below:
- [Dataset of prices of house in US](https://github.com/Adeen317/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20wth%20Python/Housing%20Dataset%20in%20US/Data_Analysis_on_housing_datasets_USA.py)
###### In the analysis on the above dataset you will learn to find datatypes, dropping of columns, boxplot, regression plot, R-square value, Pipelining and other preprocessing techniques. 
#### Dataset of prices of cars
##### In order to access the analysis code for data of car prices click the header below:
- [Dataset of prices of cars](https://github.com/Adeen317/DataAnalysis/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20wth%20Python/Categorized%20Dataset%20of%20Car%20Price)
###### The analysis on the above dataset is divided into four parts.
##### Part 1
- [Part 1](https://github.com/Adeen317/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20wth%20Python/Categorized%20Dataset%20of%20Car%20Price/Data_Analyst1_2.py)
###### >This part consists of reading the data from the URL & provides concise summary of the data.
###### >Counts and deals with missing values in the columns by replacing them with mean value of the column.
###### >Renaming and applying calculations in a column. 
###### >Check and convert datatypes. 
###### >Consists of normalization techniques (Simple Feature Scaling, Min Max Value & Z-score Value) of the data.
###### >Plots histogram after binning data in a column.

##### Part 2
- [Part 2](https://github.com/Adeen317/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20wth%20Python/Categorized%20Dataset%20of%20Car%20Price/Data_Analyst3.py)
###### >Check and converts neccessary datatypes accordingly. 
###### >This part shows the boxplot, scatterplot, jointplot, regression plot between the two columns.
###### >It also provides heatmap of combination of multiple columns.
###### >It consists of method to find correlation, Pearson correlaton(P-value) & Chi Square Value.

##### Part 3
- [Part 3](https://github.com/Adeen317/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20wth%20Python/Categorized%20Dataset%20of%20Car%20Price/Data_Analyst4.py)
###### Steps To Get Prediction:
###### >This part shows the residual plot, distribution plot, regression plot between the two columns.
###### >It performs linear and multiple linear regression.
###### >It performs polynomial regression with more than one dimension.
###### >It normalizes data.
###### >It pipelines normalizing, polynomial transform and linear regression.
###### >It also provides methods to find mean square error(MSE) and R-Square Value.

##### Part 4
- [Part 4](https://github.com/Adeen317/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Data%20Analysis%20wth%20Python/Categorized%20Dataset%20of%20Car%20Price/Data_Analyst5.py)
###### >This part splits the dataset for training and testing and cross validation is applied to obtain test and predicted value.
###### >It performs linear and multiple linear regression.
###### >It performs polynomial transform of multiple order on testing and training data.
###### >It also performs ridge regression between two components.
###### >It performs grid search according to the parameters and ridge model assigned.
###### >It also provides methods to find R-Square Value.

### Data Visualization with Python
In this section we have covered data visualzation techniques through python programming language. In order to perform visualzation in python first we need to download several libraries which are as follows:
##### 1. pandas
##### 2. matplotlib
##### 3. numpy
##### 4. Plotly
##### 5. Dash
##### 6. Folium
##### 7. Seaborn
To access all files click the header below:
- [Data Visualization with Python](https://github.com/Adeen317/DataAnalysis/tree/main/Data%20Visualization%20with%20Python)

##### It consist several visualization techniques using different libraries to help you in making accurate bussiness strategic decisions. 
- [Matplotlib](https://github.com/Adeen317/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Data%20Visualization%20with%20Python/Codes/Charts.py)
###### First of all, we use matplotlib for plotting various types of charts and plots.
- [Seaborn](https://github.com/Adeen317/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Data%20Visualization%20with%20Python/Codes/Subplot%20%26%20Seaborn.py)
###### Then, we will use seaborn library for plotting charts and plots. It also uses subplotting to display multiple plots together.

- [Plotly](https://github.com/Adeen317/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Data%20Visualization%20with%20Python/Codes/Plotly.py)
###### PLotly library is also used for creating dashboards to analyze data.

- [Folium](https://github.com/Adeen317/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Data%20Visualization%20with%20Python/Codes/Folium.py)
###### Folium is used to for geospatial data visuaization it helps in building interactive and customizable maps.

- [Dash](https://github.com/Adeen317/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Data%20Visualization%20with%20Python/Codes/Dash_Final.py)
###### Dash is used for creating interactive web-application which consists of multiple plots and charts to make correct decisions based on the analysis provided.
